## `timm_parameters`: Model Configuration Overview

`timm_parameters` is a comprehensive collection of the number of parameters for all deep learning models available in the [timm](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) (PyTorch Image Models) library.

### Included Files

- **`timm_model_parameter_counts.csv`**  
  A CSV file listing all supported models in `timm` along with their corresponding **parameter counts**, in the ascending order of parameter counts.

- **`timm_parameters.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook containing the code used to generate the CSV file.  
  It extracts model metadata such as architecture names, parameter counts, and other configuration details.

### Use Cases

This repository can be useful for:

- Quickly comparing model sizes
- Selecting appropriate models based on resource constraints
- Working with models having comparable parameters
